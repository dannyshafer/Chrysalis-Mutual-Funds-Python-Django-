# ChrysalisTwoApp (Python-Django version)

First of all, a demonstration on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIop2Y_w7M4">Youtube</a>. This is a modified version of my <a href="https://github.com/dannyshafer/ChrysalisApp-final-Sinatra-version-">Sinatra app</a> nexcept implemented in Python/Django and analyzing stocks rather than mutual funds...and consuming an api rather than manually scraping Yahoo Finance. 

Ensure that you have Python, Django, and this external module, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.1.4">Yahoo Finance</a>, installed. 

1. Clone from Github
2. Make migration by running "python manage.py migrate"
3. Start the server with "python manage.py runserver"
4. Navigate in your browser to port 8000 unless otherwise specified by your terminal
5. Enter a symbol and enjoy the ride. 

If you have ideas for improvement, feel free to submit a pull request. :D
