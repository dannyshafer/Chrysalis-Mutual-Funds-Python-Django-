# ChrysalisTwoApp (Python-Django version)

First of all, a demonstration on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIop2Y_w7M4">Youtube</a>. This is a modified version of my <a href="https://github.com/dannyshafer/ChrysalisApp-final-Sinatra-version-">Sinatra app</a> nexcept implemented in Python/Django and analyzing stocks rather than mutual funds...and consuming an api rather than manually scraping Yahoo Finance. 

Ensure that you have Python, Django, and this external module, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.1.4">Yahoo Finance</a>, installed. Clone, run migrations, server, and to the grocery store for popcorn because it's about to be a good show...
